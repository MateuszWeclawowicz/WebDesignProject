                <h3>Johan "N0tail" Sundstein - $7.2 million (<i>Dota 2</i>)</h3>
                <p>
                    The Danish Dota 2 veteran became the top earner in all of esports in 2019 after 
                    leading OG to victory at The International for the second year in a row. Aside 
                    from his impressive payday at TI8 and TI9, though, N0tail enjoyed success with 
                    long spells at OG and Fnatic prior to TI, which sets him at the top of this list.

                <h3>Kyle "Bugha" Giersdorf - $3.2 million (<i>Fortnite</i>)</h3>
                <p>
                    Fortnite exploded in 2018. It quickly became one of the most played games in the 
                    world and it was only a matter of time before esports followed suit.
                    Epic Games, the developer of the building-frenzy, children-friendly bonanza, 
                    invested millions of dollars into funding tournaments for the game-and one player, 
                    in particular, came out on top. Sentinels' Bugha's dominant performance at the 
                    Fortnite World Cup pushed the player into esports supremacy in 2019, earning himself an astonishing $3 million.
