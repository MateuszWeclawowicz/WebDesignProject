                    <h2>Highest eSport Earners</h2>
                    <h3>Johan "N0tail" Sundstein - $7.2 million (<i>Dota 2</i>)</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Danish Dota 2 veteran became the top earner in all of esports in 2019 after 
                        leading OG to victory at The International for the second year in a row. Aside 
                        from his impressive payday at TI8 and TI9, though, N0tail enjoyed success with 
                        long spells at OG and Fnatic prior to TI, which sets him at the top of this list.

                    <h3>Kyle "Bugha" Giersdorf - $3.2 million (<i>Fortnite</i>)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Fortnite exploded in 2018. It quickly became one of the most played games in the 
                        world and it was only a matter of time before esports followed suit.
                        Epic Games, the developer of the building-frenzy, children-friendly bonanza, 
                        invested millions of dollars into funding tournaments for the game-and one player, 
                        in particular, came out on top. Sentinels' Bugha's dominant performance at the 
                        Fortnite World Cup pushed the player into esports supremacy in 2019, earning himself an astonishing $3 million.

                    <h3>Peter "dupreeh" Rasmussen - $1.9 million (<i>CS:GO</i>)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Danish frag master Peter "dupreeh" Rasmussen won his fourth Valve Major with one of the greatest CS:GO teams 
                        of all time in 2019. Dupreeh played a big part in Astralis' rise to fame, cleaning up their act, and helping 
                        them push to the top of the standings in Counter-Strike.
