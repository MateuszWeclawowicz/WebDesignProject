                    League of Legends Worlds 2021 was the most watched esports event of 2021 - 
                    it had more than 174.8 million Hours Watched. It is not only the highest 
                    total for this year, but the highest of all time! The previous record belonged 
                    to Worlds 2020, and the new Worlds accumulated almost 25% more Hours Watched. 
                    In addition to the traditionally great excitement around the event, the 
                    statistics were also affected by the return of T1 and Faker, who didn't qualify for Worlds 2020.
