                    <h2>What is eSports?</h2>
                    <p>
                    eSports describes the world of competitive, organized video gaming. Competitors from 
                    different leagues or teams face off in the same games that are popular with at-home 
                    gamers: Fortnite, League of Legends, Counter-Strike, Call of Duty, Overwatch and Madden NFL, 
                    to name a few. These gamers are watched and followed by millions of fans all over the world, 
                    who attend live events or tune in on TV or online. Streaming services like Twitch allow viewers 
                    to watch as their favorite gamers play in real time, and this is typically where popular gamers build up their fandoms.

                        If you've never attended an esports tournament before, you may not know what to expect. 
                        In many ways, an esports tournament is similar to a conventional sporting event. Just like 
                        conventional playoffs and tournaments, esports formats include qualifying rounds and elimination 
                        brackets. However, various esports tournaments approach things slightly differently. Below, 
                        we break down the main types of tournament formats you are likely to encounter when exploring live esports events.

                    <h2>Who can compete?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Any esports tournament will be advertised as an open or closed event. This essentially 
                        lets you know who can participate with any given event. Open events mean anyone is free 
                        to enter. By contrast, closed events tend to operate on an invite-only basis. In these 
                        cases, those organizing an event will decide who can compete.
